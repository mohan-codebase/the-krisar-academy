With temperatures rising and many people exposed to the heat outdoors, our school stepped up with a heartwarming act of service.

                    <p className="mb-6">Under the leadership of our respected Chairman, Mr. K. K. Rajan, we organized free drinking water spots in various public areas.

                    <p className="mb-6">Strategically placed near bus stops, busy streets, and parks, these free water stations offered clean, cool drinking water to passersby. Our students volunteered enthusiastically to distribute water, refill containers, and engage with the public by spreading awareness about hydration and health.</p>

                    <p className="mb-6">Learning Through Service</p>
                    This drive wasn’t just about giving—it was about learning too. Students got first-hand experience in community service, understanding that even a small act of kindness, like offering water, can make a big difference in someone’s day.

                    Chairman Mr. K. K. Rajan encouraged students to participate actively, reminding them that serving others is one of the best forms of education.

                    A Community Inspired
                    The public appreciated this thoughtful gesture, and many were inspired to carry water bottles, share water with others, and be mindful of those in need during the summer.

                    So, the next time the sun beats down, don’t forget to drink water and offer some to those around you.
                    Because kindness, like water, should flow freely.

                <p className="mb-6">In 2018, our school took a bold step to promote healthy eating habits by organizing a Road Show on Millets and Organic Food. This inspiring event wasn’t just another school activity—it was a movement toward better health and sustainable living. <br /><br />

                    The initiative was proudly launched by our visionary Chairman, Mr. K. K. Rajan, who strongly believes in shaping young minds through real-world experiences. His leadership turned a simple awareness idea into a full-fledged campaign that reached the hearts of many. <br /><br />

                    A Road Show with a Purpose: The road show was all about creating awareness among students and the community about the importance of switching to millets and organic food. Students actively participated in the campaign, holding banners, distributing pamphlets, and spreading the message with pride and energy. <br /><br />

                    The goal? To educate people on how millets are not only nutritious and eco-friendly but also play a key role in fighting lifestyle diseases. Through this campaign, students learned the value of healthy food choices and how small steps can create big change. <br /><br />

                    Why Millets? <br /><br />

                    They are rich in fiber, iron, and essential nutrients
                    Great for managing diabetes and improving digestion
                    Environmentally friendly—require less water and pesticides
                    Organic Food – The Natural Way Forward
                    The campaign also focused on the benefits of organic farming—no chemicals, no pesticides, just pure goodness. Students encouraged their families and neighbors to choose organic products whenever possible.<br /><br />

                    A Lasting Impact
                    Thanks to the road show, many students became ambassadors of good health in their homes and communities. It wasn’t just about learning from books—it was about taking knowledge to the streets and making a difference.

                    We are proud of our students and thankful to Mr. K. K. Rajan for leading the way with such a meaningful and forward-thinking initiative.</p>
